### <span style="color:#008891">Purpose</span>

Produce decision support packages using the data from beach litter surveys conducted in Switzerland.

### About the data

The data was collected by a variety of organisations and indivdiduals. The earliest records are November 2015 on Lac LÃ©man. All the surveys follow a modified Marine Litter Watch or OSPAR method.

### How to use this repo:

Clone the repo, Jupyter lab or JupyterNotebooks are required. The workbook 'getdataforrepo' will preprocess the data for you and attach BFS numbers. All other modules draw from the data provided by 'getdataforrepo'.

!! Make sure to read the use case for each template or notebook !!

**Syncing of geo data and economic data** as new survey locations get added, there is a delay between when the explanatory vairiables are extracted. For now this gets updated weekly.
